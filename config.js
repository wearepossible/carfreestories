    title: 'The irresistible rise of people-friendly, clean air cities',
    intro: "<p>Cities around the world are moving to reduce traffic and cut the numbers of cars on roads. In many places this means walkways have been widened, roads have been rededicated to cyclists and pedestrians and the public have been incentivised to use public transport. In several places these measures added to, or grew out of already existing priorities to cut traffic, congestion and pollution. But why? Partly it is to allow for active forms of travel like walking and cycling but these efforts also produce more pleasant urban environments. But, vitally, as the impacts of the climate crisis become more and more apparent, it is also important for cities to play their part in reducing carbon emissions - emissions that also have a detrimental effect on health.</p><p>Time and time again whenever these proposals are made there comes a tide of outrage from a vocal minority. However, typically when the measures are introduced, the negatives outcried by critics never come about. People adapt their travelling habits, support gradually grows and the majority do not want to go back to how things were before.</p><p>Our mega-cities are in vital need of shifting away from cars. Of course some groups, such as those with personal mobility challenges, will still require vehicle access, but one of the best ways of meeting their needs will be clearing the roads of unnecessary cars. As the stories below show, people are remarkably good at adapting to change so as many look at leaving car culture behind, the future of better towns and cities is looking brighter.</p><h3>Share your stories</h3><p>We'd love to hear more examples of traffic reduction measures from all around the world. Do you have a story about how attitudes to traffic reduction measures near you have changed? Please share it with us by <a href='https://action.wearepossible.org/page/89254/data/1' target='_blank'>filling out this form</a>.</p>",

            description: "<p>The Paris Mayor, Anne Marie Hidalgo, is pioneering some of the most ambitious urban improvement measures linked to reducing the number of cars on the city&rsquo;s streets. In a direct response to the coronavirus pandemic, Paris introduced a further 50km of emergency bike lanes, for a total planned of 650km. It did so in just a few weeks and created the space for bikes by using semi-rigid posts and traffic barricades.</p><p>Like many well-established cities Paris was not built for modern volumes of vehicle traffic and there had been several previous attempts at tackling congestion and pollution. In 2014 the city was experiencing a serious decline in air quality. In response it experimented with a version of the &lsquo;odd / even&rsquo; scheme made famous by Delhi. Public transport was also made free in order to tempt people away from their cars. In spite of the crisis, the measures were criticised by the political opposition leader Jean-Francois Cope - who complained of there being &lsquo;panic&rsquo; on the ground.</p><p>In 2018, older petrol and diesel vehicles were banned from the city between 8am and 8pm and diesel cars are due to be banned outright in 2024 and petrol cars in 2030. These measures have also faced opposition from groups lobbying on behalf of motorists. However Hidalgo stood for reelection in 2020 with a policy on banning cars being central to her campaign and in the end, she was successfully re-elected and garnered 20% more of the vote than her nearest rival - proving the popularity of these measures.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

            description: "<p>A street bordering Brooklyn's Prospect Park in New York was reduced in 2010 from three vehicle traffic lanes to two, with the third lane turned into a two way bicycle lane. It was installed to the great delight of New York cyclists, and the extreme annoyance of some powerful and well-connected people living adjacent. A legal case was brought against the change led by a high-powered law firm.</p><p>Opponents claimed that the benefits of the bike lane were overstated by city authorities. Opponents also complained that the new bike lane had been imposed on the community, even though it was approved by the transport committee of the relevant local Community Board. Another familiar refrain was heard in the local debate &ndash; that businesses would suffer lost custom.</p><p>After a failed attempt in the 1980s to create major bike lanes, a new Transport Commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, supported by New York&rsquo;s Mayor Bloomberg, promoted the notion of the &lsquo;complete street&rsquo; &ndash; a place for more than cars &ndash; and oversaw the introduction of 255 miles of bike lanes up to Spring 2011. The number of people cycling to work doubled between 2006 and 2010 according to the authorities.</p><p>The bike lane in Prospect Park West was built in a month, and other lanes have been introduced much quicker. Their cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of road repairs, and streets with protected bike lanes saw 40% fewer accidents.</p><p>By 2012, six years into the Bloomberg administration, 66% of New Yorkers had come round to thinking that bike lanes were a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;. Only 27% said that they were a bad idea.</p> <p>In 2016, five years after the lawsuit was brought against the Prospect Park West bike lane, a move which some said nearly sank New York City&rsquo;s bike program, the action was dropped. One of the reasons the lawsuit failed, apart from lack of legal merit and factual grounds, was the steadfastness of certain councillors and the city authorities in the face of vocal but poorly grounded criticism.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

The recent <a href='https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/en/traffic/transport-policy/berlin-mobility-act/'>Mobility Act</a> and new <a href='https://cities-today.com/berlin-introduces-pedestrian-law/'>pedestrian law</a> aim to create a bigger shift to public transport, cycling and walking. But local residents are still campaigning for a far more ambitious transformation into a healthy, people-friendly city - one that designs out the majority of remaining car use.</p><p>As part of the Mobility Act, <a href='https://berlinspectator.com/2020/09/23/berlin-senates-plans-for-bicycle-highways-take-next-step/'>ten bicycle highways</a> along wide lanes are planned that will connect the city&rsquo;s outskirts and centre. Buses are set to go electric by 2030, car sharing will be promoted, and the Act has the goal of making car traffic &lsquo;climate-neutral&rsquo; by 2045.</p><p>The &lsquo;<a href='https://cities-today.com/berlin-introduces-pedestrian-law/'>pedestrian law</a>&rsquo; aims to raise the status and priority of walking as a way of getting around and includes improving mobility and the user-friendliness of streets for disabled people. It is said to be the first time in Germany that the priority of pedestrian travel has been given a legislative foundation.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic also has seen several innovations; a particularly interesting one is the rise of &lsquo;<a href='https://www.komodo.berlin/'>KoMoDo</a>&rsquo; which is a potential solution to the problem of congestion caused by internet shopping deliveries. ​​The KoMoDo brings together five large parcel service providers who can make use of cargo bikes from micro-depots for the last few kilometres of deliveries.</p><p>Pivoting away from a system designed for cars will bring multiple benefits to poorer households in Berlin and the same goes for other towns and cities as well. <a href='https://changing-cities.org/wer-in-berlin-auto-faehrt-ist-selten-arm/'>Car ownership is concentrated in wealthier residents,</a> with 44% percent of Berlin&rsquo;s wealthy residents owning one or more cars, but only 22% of those on low incomes owning a car. Those people on lower incomes will really benefit from any improvements made to alternative forms of transport.</p><p>All this being said, the pace of change is not fast enough for some citizens. A group known as <a href='https://volksentscheid-berlin-autofrei.de/index.php?lang=en'>Berlin Autofrei</a> has already begun the first stages of a legislative process that uses a &lsquo;people&rsquo;s referendum&rsquo; in an attempt to ban non-essential car traffic in the whole central area of Berlin. With a combination of official approval, in principle, to turn the tide against cars, companies innovating, and grassroots pressure, Berlin is one to watch as it works towards going car free.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

Instead of carving large wide roads through its centre, it developed pedestrian areas. Extensive parks and a tree planting scheme have led to it being nicknamed the <a href='https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25988023.pdf'>&lsquo;ecological capital of Brazil&rsquo;</a>.</p><p>One of the greatest challenges for the growing urban area was how people would get around.

In 1965 a new plan came about which would aim to &lsquo;<a href='https://curitibacityplanning.weebly.com/history.html'>remove cars from the equation</a>&rsquo;. That meant removing them from the core of the city with initiatives that had substantial citizen participation.</p><p>But what would the new system look like? Curitiba&rsquo;s solution was to develop a low cost, fully integrated and rapid bus system. Dedicated bus lanes were introduced in 1974, in 1980 terminals similar to underground stations were added and, in 1991, to make the system more attractive and comfortable for passengers, tube-like raised platforms were introduced. The whole system had a &lsquo;bus-tube&rsquo; character.</p><p>Over time, a flat fare system was introduced so that there was no disincentive to using the buses for poorer passengers and those who had to travel further into the city.</p><p>Today the Curitiba BRT system works across eight neighbouring cities, moving <a href='https://www.solutions-site.org/node/83'>1.9 million passengers around on a daily basis, and reportedly enjoys an 89% approval rating</a>.</p><p>To deal with ongoing traffic <a href='https://blogs.iadb.org/ciudades-sostenibles/en/urban-planning-three-lessons-learned-in-curitiba/'>congestion that obstructs public transport</a>, in <a href='http://cyclists-world.com/onewebmedia/93-100_Quality%20of%20Life%20and%20Bicycles%20-%20%20How%20Curitiba%20has%20become%20one%20of%20the%20world%C3%94%C3%87%C3%96s%20most%20liveable%20cities.pdf'>2013 a cycling plan</a> was introduced designed to upgrade an existing 100km of cycle paths, introduce 200km more, and integrate bike parks into all bus terminals and city parks.</p><p>Curitiba&rsquo;s example gives two key lessons: the importance of integrated long term planning which puts people first and the importance of openness to innovation and improvement.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

On top of that Freiburg also faced opposition from local businesses who feared that new controls on car use would have a negative impact. In spite of this, Freiburg was able to coordinate transport and land use to increase journeys by bike threefold, double public transport use, and cut the share of trips by car by 32%, meaning that over two thirds of journeys are now made by public transport, walking and bike.</p><p>The number of cars and light trucks owned per head of population fell in Freiburg over two decades, even as it has risen steadily for Germany as a whole.</p><p>Freiburg began with above-average car use until things started to change around 1970. Bike networks, expanded light rail, pedestrianisation and deliberately planning new developments for both homes and businesses close to public transport all contributed to the transition. By 1980 the car officially took second priority to pedal, foot and mass transit. By 2008 the city had several cycle-only streets, and nine out of ten residents lived in areas where traffic could not go faster than 30km p/h (19 mph).</p><p>In many areas the speed limit drops to 7km p/h (5 mph).

Prior to this, however, during 1996, there were over 300 public hearings to allow for extensive consultation on the proposals. That wasn&rsquo;t all. Advance notice of proposed road closures was also carefully communicated using a range of media channels including radio, television, maps and posters. Households were even mailed and a phone information line was established. Then, overnight in November 1997, and still in the face of much resistance, through traffic was stopped from entering the city centre.</p><p>The congestion that opponents warned of did not come about. Public transport use increased, the centre was opened to pedestrians and a range of life-enhancing cultural activities, making it more attractive to residents and visitors, began. Ghent not only built new infrastructure for cycling, including 300km of cycle routes and 7500 rental bikes, but the city also promoted the culture of cycling with art and exhibitions to increase its appeal.

The city returned its 300,000 square metre city centre to pedestrians in 1999 and as a consequence brought multiple economic, social and health benefits to residents. Since banning cars, Pontevedra has enjoyed a drastic drop in traffic accidents, reduced anti-social behaviour and lower pollution levels. With three quarters of all journeys formerly made by car now made on foot or by bike, there have been positive health outcomes for fitter, local citizens too.</p><p>Similarly, following suit to improve life in the city and open up its streets for people Madrid decided also to reduce access for cars. In 2018 Madrid made the centre of the city into an &lsquo;ultra low emission zone&rsquo; which effectively banned most cars.</p><p>On this occasion the scheme proved popular from the outset with the active support of a significant majority of the public with 64% of city residents in favour.. Within months of Madrid&rsquo;s measures being introduced levels of the toxic vehicle pollutant, nitrogen dioxide, were reportedly down by 48%.</p><p>However, in 2019, when a rightwing political party won power in the city government, it moved to suspend the congestion reduction initiative. In response, a mass demonstration was organised by <em>Plataforma en Defensa de Madrid Central</em> to reintroduce the measures. Then, when a legal case was brought against the suspension, an administrative court judge in the city overruled the new council, restoring the popular scheme.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

            description: "<p>Medell&iacute;n, the second largest city in Colombia, is an example of how the bold re-imagining of public space and the innovative use of public transport can overcome far greater threats and obstacles. In the early 1990s, Medell&iacute;n was the most violent city in the world. Since the early 2000s, however, the city has seen a remarkable transformation, becoming a world-renowned centre of innovation and tourist hub with a thriving civil society. It is now admired by city planners around the world for its innovative architecture and public infrastructure.</p><p>The transformation was accomplished by a progressive coalition of academics, community organisers and business people, who came together in the late 1990s to actively engage with communities and seek solutions to Medell&iacute;n&rsquo;s crisis. The coalition came up with proposals to invest in education, public infrastructure and public spaces in the city. The coalition came to be called Compromiso Ciudadano (&ldquo;citizen commitment&rdquo;), and eventually formed into a political party.</p><p>In 2003, the party&rsquo;s mayoral candidate, Sergio Farjado, was elected on a ticket based on the movement&rsquo;s proposals. Farjado dedicated his mayoral term to &ldquo;repaying the historic social debt&rdquo; to the poorest parts of the city. The collection of policies that he put in place included developing new public spaces, schools, parks and public libraries and supporting local businesses in the lowest-income areas of the city.</p><p>The participatory process to reimagine the city created a vibrant civic culture that still exists today. Decisive to Medell&iacute;n&rsquo;s social and security transition was the transformation of its physical space to be more inclusive. This was aided when Colombia launched a new National Constitution in 1991 which recognised public space as a constitutional right. This was used by subsequent mayors to justify changes.</p><p>Today, Medell&iacute;n now hosts Colombia&rsquo;s most advanced sustainable public transport network, and the city has vastly increased and enhanced green spaces, including through the development of a new green belt around the city&rsquo;s periphery.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

In 2012 the city authorities introduced a selective vehicle charge to reduce traffic and improve air quality. It was scrapped after a legal challenge by a private car park claimed it was affecting their business.</p><p>The impact of the forced removal of the traffic charge after several months was surprising, with vehicles returning immediately. During the schemes there had been an overall decline in vehicle numbers of 14.5% when only 19% of vehicles were subject to the charge. The initiative was later restored, but the advent of the coronavirus pandemic led to a more ambitious plan to reduce traffic in Milan.</p><p><strong>Open streets</strong><br />Now, Milan&rsquo;s municipal Strade Aperte (Open Streets) initiative is being cited as a model for improving the quality of central urban environments. It was triggered as local politicians feared that restrictions on public transport might cause serious health and environmental problems if people switched to cars. In order to ensure that space was available for social distancing, local authorities set out to reduce the space available for cars and increase it for pedestrians, cyclists and people using electric bikes and motorcycles. These measures are now intended to be permanent.</p><p>The measures include 35km of new cycle lanes, new and wider pavements, and expanded areas for children to play in. Some streets now give priority to people walking and cycling and 30kph (20mph) speed limits have been introduced on multiple roads. In one area known as the Lazaretto a low traffic neighbourhood has been created. and on the main Corso Buenos Aires, new bike lanes have been created along major shopping streets which are being combined with other measures in efforts towards pedestrianisation. Milan could also be said to have started a trend in Italy.</p><p><strong>The &lsquo;15 minute neighbourhood&rsquo; &ndash; reimagining town and city life</strong><br />Behind the practical steps taken by Milanese authorities is a bigger vision. The aim is to make Lazzaretto and Isola pilot projects for ensuring that everything people need to live their lives is within a 15-minute walking distance.</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Open Squares&rsquo; - improving the public realm with more and better space</strong><br />Italy&rsquo;s famous town and city squares reveal the importance of public space and a high quality public realm for urban life. &lsquo;Open squares&rsquo; is another component related to the new measures in which 15 city squares have been improved over an 18 month period by increasing space for pedestrians and active travel such as cycling.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

Standards for legally permissible pollution levels from vehicles have also been tightened along with the introduction of penalties for burning rubbish.</p><p>But all of these have been progressively overwhelmed by trends like the rise in vehicle numbers. In a decade from 2002 to 2012 theynearly doubledin Delhi, increasing 97%. Officially, Delhi is now kerosene free and most households use LPG for cooking. But in spite of positive steps like the switching of public transport to cleaner fuel, pollution is still responsible for 10,000-30,000 annual deaths in Delhi according to India&rsquo;s Centre for Science and Environment.</p><p>Delhi had a crisis moment in November 2016 when particulate matter rose to over ten times the highest acceptable healthy limit. This led to what is known as the odd-even initiative. For a limited period of time, private cars in the city were controlled, with private cars being allowed onto the roads on alternate days according to whether their number plates bore odd or even numbers. The initiative faced opposition and legal challenges. Reportedly around nine out of ten people opposed the initiative prior to its implementation with a majority switching to being supportive after the fact.</p><p>New Delhi authorities reported falls in pollution of up to 25% in the two week duration of the scheme and reduced levels of congestion. In addition to raisingpublic awareness of the problem, the introduction of odd/even also improved road conditions for public transport making it more efficient. Official figures reported that public buses &ndash; which have a daily target of covering 200km but typically only managed 160km &ndash; managed to serve 220km per day5. Bus passenger numbers increased from 4.7 million per day to 5.3 million.</p><p>Since its initial introduction the odd / even scheme has been used successively during the smog season when air quality has dramatically worsened.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

Neither, again, did the warned-of wholesale transfer of traffic onto nearby roads occur.

Most on-street parking was replaced with bike lanes and pavement for pedestrians. New street furniture such as benches were also introduced along with miniature parks. Certain major streets were closed to traffic, congestion charges were introduced along with lower, safer speed limits.One of the ways that Oslo came to overcome the doubts and opposition was by first experimenting with pilot projects.</p><p>Indicative, perhaps, of a broader cultural shift, something else extraordinary happened in 2019.

Daily commutes by bike went up by nearly six times, and public transport by over 50%.</p><p>As of 2008, the substantial cycling infrastructure had been created at the cost of a single mile of normal urban freeway.

Each involved the introduction of new bike or bus lanes, or both together. It also included 30 miles of new ‘low stress’ bike lanes. The city expects its population to increase significantly in the future, and without new, greener transport options could see a huge traffic increase of up to 47%.</p><p>But Portland’s plans have been influenced by the city of Seattle, which attracted 60,000 jobs in its downtown area, but by investing heavily in public transit, did not increase the number of cars on its roads.

Once people had lived with the changes for a while, however, things changed dramatically. Five years after its introduction, in 2011, opposition had switched to support. As many of the public - seven out of ten - were now in favour of the scheme as had been against it.</p><p>Stockholm&rsquo;s initiative revealed two other important insights. The first was the speed with which car users responded to measures like road pricing. When there was a pause in the policy in mid-2006, traffic levels increased overnight, quickly returning to almost the same levels as before the scheme.</p><p>The second point of interest was the way in which people adapted, to the point that many could not remember, or even admit to, ever having been opposed to the measures in the first place. This emerged during research to discover who amongst drivers had experienced a change of heart. But the findings didn&rsquo;t correlate because a disproportionate number claimed always to have been in favour of the congestion charges.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

            description: "<p>In 1992 Strasbourg, France embarked on a &lsquo;plan de circulation&rsquo; that would see the expansion of central areas opened-up for public transport and active travel - cycling and walking - and closed to private cars. Following a familiar pattern, there were warnings that the exclusion of private cars from the centre would lead to &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; and congestion. But, once again, the upheaval did not materialise.</p><p>The scheme was designed to improve quality of life, reduce pollution and make the city more attractive to residents and visitors by encouraging a full modal shift in people&rsquo;s travelling habits, switching to active travel and public transport. Along with the scheme came a new tramline which led to a 17% reduction in traffic coming into the wider city area in its first year alone. Its success led to two further tramlines being installed by 2010. Over the course of a decade from 1989 to 1999, trips made by public transport went up from 11% to 30%.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t easy. There was a powerful opposition campaign that feared that the physical changes and pedestrianisation would reduce the number of customers. The city engaged in widespread consultation and also staged a major communications exercise &ndash; with a popular &lsquo;bear&rsquo; symbol and comprehensive signage explaining the changes. There was also a phone-in advice line. The scheme ultimately proved to be a popular and political success with some businesses and residents even calling for a further expansion of traffic reduction measures. Property values were enhanced and the use of parking restrictions triggered greater turnover for businesses.</p><p>Strasbourg also innovated as the first city in France to use an &lsquo;intelligent traffic management system&rsquo;. The approach works by reducing the number of stop-and-go waves along its roads, cutting vehicle stops by 9% which lowers emissions of harmful nitrogen oxide and particulates by 8% and 9% respectively. Trams are also given priority over other forms of traffic.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",

One of the cities to pioneer this way of making towns and cities more pleasant to live in and get around is the capital of Estonia, Tallinn.</p><p>City authorities view the measure as a way to encourage people to switch from cars to trams and buses, while improving the local economy in the process. Initially, the move was explained to the public and a subsequent vote delivered a result of over <a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17517106'>75% in support</a>. Experimentation in the early 2000s eventually resulted in free public transport becoming available to all the city&rsquo;s residents in 2013 - the first European capital to do such a thing.</p><p>The<a href='https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecoap/about-eco-innovation/good-practices/estonia/20130617-capital-of-free-public-transport_en'> immediate response was positive</a>. Congestion fell by 15%, public transport use went up 12.6% and overall car use dropped 9% in just the first few months. Awareness of the move also had a surprise benefit. Attracted by the new policy, thousands more people registered as Tallinn residents, boosting municipal income by <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/11/tallinn-experiment-estonia-public-transport-free-cities'>&euro;20 million per year</a>.</p><p>There was initial scepticism about the policy among local politicians, but now none of the main local political parties proposed removing the scheme.</p><p>To help the shift, the city authorities also raised parking fees and reduced the number of car parking spaces. The rest of the country is now following Tallinn&rsquo;s example, with Estonia declaring an ambition in 2018 to introduce<a href='https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/05/09/free-public-transport-in-estonia'> free public transport nationwide</a>. Free buses have been introduced in 11 of the 15 counties. The example influenced Luxembourg to follow suit; it introduced free travel across the country in 2020. During the first year of the pandemic city traffic<a href='https://news.err.ee/1182868/effects-of-the-pandemic-in-tallinn-fewer-cars-and-emptier-buses'> reduced by another 17%</a> and time will tell if this shift further helps Tallinn kick the car habit.</p><p><a href='#minimap' class='anchor'>Return to the minimap</a></p>",
