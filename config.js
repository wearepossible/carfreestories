    title: 'Stories of Change',
    subtitle: 'The irresistible rise of people-friendly, clean air cities',
    intro: "<p>There are many reasons why cities around the world are moving to reduce traffic and cut the numbers of cars on roads. Partly it is to make way for active forms of travel like walking and cycling. And partly it is to produce more pleasant urban environments. Playing their part in the task of reducing carbon emissions and tackling the climate emergency is another reason.</p><p>Besides its severe impact on the climate emergency, transport emissions are also damaging for health reasons. Annually, around 1.35 million people are killed, with anything between 20 - 50 million more being injured - with many left with permanent disabilities. And then there is vehicles’ emission of a large amount of pollutants. According to the European Environment Agency, the most concerning of these are nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Despite legal limits governed by European legislation, populations living in urban areas still breathe air that is above safe limits. Adults breathe around 15,000 litres of air per day. If that air is polluted the internal damage it can cause, rapidly accumulates.</p><p>The consequences are not yet fully understood. Worryingly, the range and scale of health impacts are constantly being found to be larger than previously thought. For the World Health Organisation (WHO), out of their estimate of 8 million premature deaths caused by air pollution around the world, half of these are due to ambient air pollution.. More recent research from three British universities and Harvard says that the picture could be much worse. Looking at the impact of fossil fuel related air pollution more in-depth they found that more than 8 million deaths could be attributed to it which accounted for nearly one in 5 of all premature deaths globally.</p><p>When responding to the pandemic, many towns and cities responded with measures designed to ensure enough space for social distancing. In many places this meant reducing traffic, widening walkways and rededicating roads to cyclists and pedestrians. In several places these measures added to, or grew out of already existing priorities to cut traffic, congestion and pollution. At a local level in the UK one range of initiatives became known as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods or ‘LTNs’. A small number of vocal opponents to LTNs generated a large public and media debate, creating the impression of widespread opposition.</p><p>As this report will show, this is nothing new. In fact it fits a long-established pattern. Time and time again whenever proposals are made to introduce controls on unlimited traffic and car use, there comes a tide of outrage from a vocal minority. What is little-known about however, is the accompanying well-trodden path as to what happens next. Typically when the measures are introduced, the negative consequences that drive many of the outcries do not materialise, people adapt their travelling habits, support gradually grows and the majority do not want to go back to how things were before.</p><p>Where LTNs are concerned, history is already repeating itself. Polling in the UK in late 2020 found that three times more people had a positive view of the measures than a negative one. In the mega-city of London 44 percent supported LTNs compared with just 21 percent opposing them. Sharpening the need for traffic reduction action, medical research is constantly revealing ever wider impacts from air pollution, including to mental health.</p><p>If there weren’t already enough reasons for our mega-cities to go car free (not to mention many other towns and cities radically reducing traffic) there are now even more. It helps to know that this journey is not new, but merely the next step of applying what we know to improve quality of life at street level. Of course some groups, such as those with personal mobility challenges, will still require vehicle access, but one of the best ways of meeting their needs will be clearing the roads of unnecessary cars. History has shown what works, and that whatever our fears, people are remarkably good at adapting to change. As many leave car culture behind, the path towards better towns and cities is looking clearer.",

            description: '<p>The city of Freiburg has been called Germany&rsquo;s environmental capital because of its transformative rethinking of transport. The higher the share of urban trips taken by public transport, bicycle and on foot, the less carbon emissions there are from road use. But in Germany, car makers are a powerful lobby. On top of that Freiburg also faced opposition from local businesses who feared that new controls on car use would have a negative impact. In spite of this, Freiburg was able to coordinate transport and land use to increase journeys by bike threefold, double public transport use, and cut the share of trips by car by 32 per cent, meaning that over two thirds of journeys are now made by public transport, walking and bike.</p><p>The number of cars and light trucks owned per head of population fell in Freiburg over two decades, even as it has risen steadily for Germany as a whole.</p><p>Freiburg began with above-average car use until things started to change around 1970. Bike networks, expanded light rail, pedestrianisation and deliberately planning new developments for both homes and businesses close to public transport all contributed to the transition. By 1980 the car officially took second priority to pedal, foot and mass transit. By 2008 the city had several cycle-only streets, and nine out of ten residents lived in areas where traffic could not go faster than 30km p/h (19 mph).</p><p>In many areas the speed limit drops to 7km p/h (5 mph). The city set an example now widely being emulated.</p>',

            description: "<p>In an attempt to address congestion and worsening air quality, the historic centre of Nuremberg was progressively pedestrianized from the early 1970s. Potential road chaos resulting from the moves, predicted by some planners, did not materialise, nor did a loss of customers to local shops warned of by business owners. Neither, again, did the warned-of wholesale transfer of traffic onto nearby roads occur. There were only marginal numbers that did, and there was actually a significant reduction of cars.</p><p>In 1988 the last through-route was closed in a trial that was, at the time, the focus of a high level of protest and opposition, especially from retailers. Again, severe congestion in adjacent streets was forecast but never materialised. Over a 12 month period total traffic reduced by around one quarter, with only marginal displacement to nearby streets, and in 1989 the measures went from trial to being permanent. Over the course of the year air pollution fell significantly with nitrogen dioxide levels falling by around 30%.</p><p>Subsequently there was a programme of continual improvement of the city centre public space. The actual traffic reduction transpired to be double what was expected.</p><p>Before the measures were introduced there was substantial public consultation and long term measuring of traffic flows afterwards to understand &lsquo;knock&rsquo;-on&rsquo; effects.</p><p>Instead of traffic simply being displaced to other parts of the city within its outer ring road, the initial absolute reduction continued in following years. It meant that against a backdrop of rising car ownership, between 1989 and 2000, there was a reduction of 10,000 vehicles on city centre area roads.</p>",

            description: "<p>In terms of air pollution, the worst-hit city in the world recently has been Delhi &ndash; where traffic has been growing inexorably and is a major contributor to poor air quality. Other contributing factors include dust from construction, pollution from factories and power stations, the burning of fuel and the burning of crops.</p><p>To lower levels of dangerous &lsquo;particulate matter&rsquo;, the Supreme Court in 1998 ordered that public transport shift from diesel fuel to compressed natural gas.Other measures included the introduction of unleaded petrol and lowering the sulphur content of fuels. Standards for legally permissible pollution levels from vehicles have also been tightened along with the introduction of penalties for burning rubbish.</p><p>But all of these have been progressively overwhelmed by trends like the rise in vehicle numbers. In a decade from 2002 to 2012 they&nbsp;nearly doubled&nbsp;in Delhi, increasing 97 percent. Officially, Delhi is now kerosene free and most households use LPG for cooking. But in spite of positive steps like the switching of public transport to cleaner fuel, pollution is still responsible for 10,000-30,000 annual deaths in Delhi according to India&rsquo;s Centre for Science and Environment.</p><p>Delhi had a crisis moment in November 2016 when particulate matter rose to over ten times the highest acceptable healthy limit. This led to what is known as the odd-even initiative. For a limited period of time, private cars in the city were controlled, with private cars being allowed onto the roads on alternate days according to whether their number plates bore odd or even numbers. The initiative faced opposition and legal challenges. Reportedly around nine out of ten people opposed the initiative prior to its implementation with a majority switching to being supportive after the fact.</p><p>New Delhi authorities reported falls in pollution of up to 25 percent in the two week duration of the scheme and reduced levels of congestion. In addition to raisingpublic awareness of the problem, the introduction of odd/even also improved road conditions for public transport making it more efficient. Official figures reported that public buses &ndash; which have a daily target of covering 200km but typically only managed 160km &ndash; managed to serve 220km per day5. Bus passenger numbers increased from 4.7 million per day to 5.3 million.</p><p>Since its initial introduction the odd / even scheme has been used successively during the smog season when air quality has dramatically worsened.</p>",

            description: "<p>A city that has become synonymous with traffic and congestion is Milan, Italy. It has, at varying times, taken measures to address its problems. In 2012 the city authorities introduced a selective vehicle charge to reduce traffic and improve air quality. It was scrapped after a legal challenge by a private car park claimed it was affecting their business.</p><p>The impact of the forced removal of the traffic charge after several months was surprising, with vehicles returning immediately. During the schemes there had been an overall decline in vehicle numbers of 14.5 percent when only 19 percent of vehicles were subject to the charge. The initiative was later restored, but the advent of the coronavirus pandemic led to a more ambitious plan to reduce traffic in Milan.</p><p><strong>Open streets</strong><br />Now, Milan&rsquo;s municipal Strade Aperte (Open Streets) initiative is being cited as a model for improving the quality of central urban environments. It was triggered as local politicians feared that restrictions on public transport might cause serious health and environmental problems if people switched to cars. In order to ensure that space was available for social distancing, local authorities set out to reduce the space available for cars and increase it for pedestrians, cyclists and people using electric bikes and motorcycles. These measures are now intended to be permanent.</p><p>The measures include 35km of new cycle lanes, new and wider pavements, and expanded areas for children to play in. Some streets now give priority to people walking and cycling and 30kph (20mph) speed limits have been introduced on multiple roads. In one area known as the Lazaretto a low traffic neighbourhood has been created. and on the main Corso Buenos Aires, new bike lanes have been created along major shopping streets which are being combined with other measures in efforts towards pedestrianisation. Milan could also be said to have started a trend in Italy.</p><p><strong>The &lsquo;15 minute neighbourhood&rsquo; &ndash; reimagining town and city life</strong><br />Behind the practical steps taken by Milanese authorities is a bigger vision. The aim is to make Lazzaretto and Isola pilot projects for ensuring that everything people need to live their lives is within a 15-minute walking distance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Open Squares&rsquo; - improving the public realm with more and better space</strong><br />Italy&rsquo;s famous town and city squares reveal the importance of public space and a high quality public realm for urban life. &lsquo;Open squares&rsquo; is another component related to the new measures in which 15 city squares have been improved over an 18 month period by increasing space for pedestrians and active travel such as cycling.</p>",

It was installed to the great delight of New York cyclists, and the extreme annoyance of some powerful and well-connected people living adjacent. A legal case was brought against the change led by a high-powered law firm.</p><p>Opponents claimed that the benefits of the bike lane were overstated by city authorities. Opponents also complained that the new bike lane had been imposed on the community, even though it was approved by the transport committee of the <a href='https://nymag.com/news/features/bike-wars-2011-3/'>relevant local Community Board</a>. Another familiar refrain was heard in the local debate &ndash; that businesses would suffer lost custom.</p><p>After a failed attempt in the 1980s to create major bike lanes, a new Transport Commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, supported by New York&rsquo;s Mayor Bloomberg, promoted the notion of the &lsquo;complete street&rsquo; &ndash; a place for more than cars &ndash; and oversaw the introduction of 255 miles of bike lanes up to Spring 2011. The number of people cycling to work doubled between 2006 and 2010 according to the authorities.</p><p>The bike lane in Prospect Park West was built in a month, and other lanes have been introduced much quicker. Their cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of road repairs, and streets with protected bike lanes saw 40% fewer accidents.</p><p>By 2012, six years into the Bloomberg administration, <a href'https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/nyregion/most-new-yorkers-say-bike-lanes-are-a-good-idea.html'>66% of New Yorkers</a> had come round to thinking that bike lanes were a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;. Only 27% said that they were a bad idea.</p><p>In 2016, five years after the lawsuit was brought against the Prospect Park West bike lane, a move which some said <a href='https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2016/09/22/good-riddance-to-the-prospect-park-west-bike-lane-lawsuit/'>nearly sank New York City&rsquo;s bike program</a>, the action was dropped.

As many of the public - seven out of ten - were now in favour of the scheme as had been against it.</p><p>Stockholm&rsquo;s initiative revealed two other important insights. The first was the speed with which car users responded to measures like road pricing. When there was a pause in the policy in mid-2006, traffic levels increased overnight, quickly returning to almost the same levels as before the scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>The second point of interest was the way in which people adapted, to the point that many could not remember, or even admit to, ever having been opposed to the measures in the first place.

Since banning cars, Pontevedra has enjoyed a drastic drop in traffic accidents, reduced anti-social behaviour and lower pollution levels. With three quarters of all journeys formerly made by car now made on foot or by bike, there have been positive health outcomes for fitter, local citizens too.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, following suit to improve life in the city and open up its streets for people Madrid decided also to reduce access for cars. In 2018 Madrid made the centre of the city into an &lsquo;ultra low emission zone&rsquo; which effectively banned most cars.</p><p>On this occasion the scheme proved popular from the outset with the active support of a significant majority of the public with 64 percent of city residents in favour.. Within months of Madrid&rsquo;s measures being introduced levels of the toxic vehicle pollutant, nitrogen dioxide, were reportedly down by 48 percent.</p><p>However, in 2019, when a rightwing political party won power in the city government, it moved to suspend the congestion reduction initiative. In response, a mass demonstration was organised by <em>Plataforma en Defensa de Madrid Central</em> to reintroduce the measures. Then, when a legal case was brought against the suspension, an administrative court judge in the city overruled the new council, restoring the popular scheme.</p>",

Not just an annual event like the traditional World Car Free Day, it has been held every Sunday since 2012 on the city’s main avenues. Jakarta is the most high profile Indonesian city to start weekly car free days, but it wasn’t the first - they were led by Bogor and Malang. Each week the streets are reclaimed by people and given over to a wide variety of activities, with many also enjoying walks, the absence of traffic and cleaner air. The event proves extremely popular with children, families and young people.</p>",

In a direct response to the coronavirus pandemic, Paris introduced a further 50km of emergency bike lanes, for a total planned of 650km. It did so in just a few weeks and created the space for bikes by using semi-rigid posts and traffic barricades.</p><p>Like many well-established cities Paris was not built for modern volumes of vehicle traffic and there had been several previous attempts at tackling congestion and pollution. In 2014 the city was experiencing a serious decline in air quality. In response it experimented with a version of the &lsquo;odd / even&rsquo; scheme made famous by Delhi. Public transport was also made free in order to tempt people away from their cars. In spite of the crisis, the measures were criticised by the political opposition leader Jean-Francois Cope - who complained of there being &lsquo;panic&rsquo; on the ground.</p><p>In 2018, older petrol and diesel vehicles were banned from the city between 8am and 8pm and diesel cars are due to be banned outright in 2024 and petrol cars in 2030. These measures have also faced opposition from groups lobbying on behalf of motorists. However Hidalgo stood for reelection in 2020 with a policy on banning cars being central to her campaign and in the end, she was successfully re-elected and garnered 20% more of the vote than her nearest rival - proving the popularity of these measures.</p>",

            description: "<p>In 1992 Strasbourg, France embarked on a &lsquo;plan de circulation&rsquo; that would see the expansion of central areas opened-up for public transport and active travel - cycling and walking - and closed to private cars. Following a familiar pattern, there were warnings that the exclusion of private cars from the centre would lead to &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; and congestion. But, once again, the upheaval did not materialise.</p><p>The scheme was designed to improve quality of life, reduce pollution and make the city more attractive to residents and visitors by encouraging a full modal shift in people&rsquo;s travelling habits, switching to active travel and public transport. Along with the scheme came a new tramline which led to a 17 percent reduction in traffic coming into the wider city area in its first year alone. Its success led to two further tramlines being installed by 2010. Over the course of a decade from 1989 to 1999, trips made by public transport went up from 11 percent to 30 percent.</p><p>But it wasn&rsquo;t easy. There was a powerful opposition campaign that feared that the physical changes and pedestrianisation would reduce the number of customers. The city engaged in widespread consultation and also staged a major communications exercise &ndash; with a popular &lsquo;bear&rsquo; symbol and comprehensive signage explaining the changes. There was also a phone-in advice line. The scheme ultimately proved to be a popular and political success with some businesses and residents even calling for a further expansion of traffic reduction measures. Property values were enhanced and the use of parking restrictions triggered greater turnover for businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Strasbourg also innovated as the first city in France to use an &lsquo;intelligent traffic management system&rsquo;. The approach works by reducing the number of stop-and-go waves along its roads, cutting vehicle stops by 9% which lowers emissions of harmful nitrogen oxide and particulates by 8% and 9% respectively. Trams are also given priority over other forms of traffic.</p>",

An early attempt was made in 1987 to reduce traffic and begin to address the combined problems of congestion, air and noise pollution, and poor conditions for cyclists, pedestrians and public transport. But the plan was cancelled after only 5 months due to vociferous protests from retailers.&nbsp;</p><p>A cycling plan was then introduced in 1993 followed by a city centre mobility plan in 1997. Prior to this, however, during 1996, there were over 300 public hearings to allow for extensive consultation on the proposals. That wasn&rsquo;t all. Advance notice of proposed road closures was also carefully communicated using a range of media channels including radio, television, maps and posters. Households were even mailed and a phone information line was established. Then, overnight in November 1997, and still in the face of much resistance, through traffic was stopped from entering the city centre.&nbsp;</p><p>The congestion that opponents warned of did not come about. Public transport use increased, the centre was opened to pedestrians and a range of life-enhancing cultural activities, making it more attractive to residents and visitors, began. Ghent not only built new infrastructure for cycling, including 300km of cycle routes and 7500 rental bikes, but the city also promoted the culture of cycling with art and exhibitions to increase its appeal. Journeys are now quicker by bike than by car.</p><p>In a decade the share of commutes by bike rose to one in five, more than double the national average, up from just 12 per cent. Ghent plans to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and won an international prize, the Eurostar Ashden Award for Sustainable Travel, in 2012.</p>",

The turnaround was the result of years of considered work reducing traffic on the city&rsquo;s streets.</p><p>In spite of such extraordinary achievements, Oslo&rsquo;s shift to designing-out the car from the city has faced increasingly familiar opposition. Some from those who simply have had difficulty adapting to change, and more from individuals fearing a loss of business when cars are reduced on roads. In fact, Oslo city centre reported an increase of footfall of 10 per cent after reduction measures indicating that they made the streets more attractive to pedestrians.</p><p>What were some of the steps taken by the city? Most on-street parking was replaced with bike lanes and pavement for pedestrians. New street furniture such as benches were also introduced along with miniature parks. Certain major streets were closed to traffic, congestion charges were introduced along with lower, safer speed limits.&nbsp;One of the ways that Oslo came to overcome the doubts and opposition was by first experimenting with pilot projects.</p><p>Indicative, perhaps, of a broader cultural shift, something else extraordinary happened in 2019. Not a single child under the age of 15 anywhere in the whole country of Norway died in a road crash.

In the early 1990s, Medell&iacute;n was the most violent city in the world. Since the early 2000s, however, the city has seen a remarkable transformation, becoming a world-renowned centre of innovation and tourist hub with a thriving civil society. It is now admired by city planners around the world for its innovative architecture and public infrastructure.</p><p>The transformation was accomplished by a progressive coalition of academics, community organisers and business people, who came together in the late 1990s to actively engage with communities and seek solutions to Medell&iacute;n&rsquo;s crisis. The coalition came up with proposals to invest in education, public infrastructure and public spaces in the city. The coalition came to be called Compromiso Ciudadano (&ldquo;citizen commitment&rdquo;), and eventually formed into a political party.</p><p>In 2003, the party&rsquo;s mayoral candidate, Sergio Farjado, was elected on a ticket based on the movement&rsquo;s proposals. Farjado dedicated his mayoral term to &ldquo;repaying the historic social debt&rdquo; to the poorest parts of the city. The collection of policies that he put in place included developing new public spaces, schools, parks and public libraries and supporting local businesses in the lowest-income areas of the city.&nbsp;</p><p>The participatory process to reimagine the city created a vibrant civic culture that still exists today. Decisive to Medell&iacute;n&rsquo;s social and security transition was the transformation of its physical space to be more inclusive. This was aided when Colombia launched a new National Constitution in 1991 which recognised public space as a constitutional right. This was used by subsequent mayors to justify changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Medell&iacute;n now hosts Colombia&rsquo;s most advanced sustainable public transport network, and the city has vastly increased and enhanced green spaces, including through the development of a new green belt around the city&rsquo;s periphery.</p>",
