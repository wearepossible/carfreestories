    subtitle: 'The irresistible rise of people-friendly, clean air cities',
    intro: "<p>There are many reasons why cities around the world are moving to reduce traffic and cut the numbers of cars on roads. Partly it is to make way for active forms of travel like walking and cycling. And partly it is to produce more pleasant urban environments. Playing their part in the task of reducing carbon emissions and tackling the climate emergency is another reason.</p><p>Besides its severe impact on the climate emergency, transport emissions are also damaging for health reasons. Annually, around 1.35 million people are killed, with anything between 20 - 50 million more being injured - with many left with permanent disabilities. And then there is vehicles’ emission of a large amount of pollutants. According to the European Environment Agency, the most concerning of these are nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Despite legal limits governed by European legislation, populations living in urban areas still breathe air that is above safe limits. Adults breathe around 15,000 litres of air per day. If that air is polluted the internal damage it can cause, rapidly accumulates.</p><p>The consequences are not yet fully understood. Worryingly, the range and scale of health impacts are constantly being found to be larger than previously thought. For the World Health Organisation (WHO), out of their estimate of 8 million premature deaths caused by air pollution around the world, half of these are due to ambient air pollution.. More recent research from three British universities and Harvard says that the picture could be much worse. Looking at the impact of fossil fuel related air pollution more in-depth they found that more than 8 million deaths could be attributed to it which accounted for nearly one in 5 of all premature deaths globally.</p><p>When responding to the pandemic, many towns and cities responded with measures designed to ensure enough space for social distancing. In many places this meant reducing traffic, widening walkways and rededicating roads to cyclists and pedestrians. In several places these measures added to, or grew out of already existing priorities to cut traffic, congestion and pollution. At a local level in the UK one range of initiatives became known as Low Traffic Neighbourhoods or ‘LTNs’. A small number of vocal opponents to LTNs generated a large public and media debate, creating the impression of widespread opposition.</p><p>As this report will show, this is nothing new. In fact it fits a long-established pattern. Time and time again whenever proposals are made to introduce controls on unlimited traffic and car use, there comes a tide of outrage from a vocal minority. What is little-known about however, is the accompanying well-trodden path as to what happens next. Typically when the measures are introduced, the negative consequences that drive many of the outcries do not materialise, people adapt their travelling habits, support gradually grows and the majority do not want to go back to how things were before.</p><p>Where LTNs are concerned, history is already repeating itself. Polling in the UK in late 2020 found that three times more people had a positive view of the measures than a negative one. In the mega-city of London 44 percent supported LTNs compared with just 21 percent opposing them. Sharpening the need for traffic reduction action, medical research is constantly revealing ever wider impacts from air pollution, including to mental health.</p><p>If there weren’t already enough reasons for our mega-cities to go car free (not to mention many other towns and cities radically reducing traffic) there are now even more. It helps to know that this journey is not new, but merely the next step of applying what we know to improve quality of life at street level. Of course some groups, such as those with personal mobility challenges, will still require vehicle access, but one of the best ways of meeting their needs will be clearing the roads of unnecessary cars. History has shown what works, and that whatever our fears, people are remarkably good at adapting to change. As many leave car culture behind, the path towards better towns and cities is looking clearer.",

            description: '<p>The city of Freiburg has been called Germany&rsquo;s environmental capital because of its transformative rethinking of transport. The higher the share of urban trips taken by public transport, bicycle and on foot, the less carbon emissions there are from road use. But in Germany, car makers are a powerful lobby. On top of that Freiburg also faced opposition from local businesses who feared that new controls on car use would have a negative impact. In spite of this, Freiburg was able to coordinate transport and land use to increase journeys by bike threefold, double public transport use, and cut the share of trips by car by 32 per cent, meaning that over two thirds of journeys are now made by public transport, walking and bike.</p><p>The number of cars and light trucks owned per head of population fell in Freiburg over two decades, even as it has risen steadily for Germany as a whole.</p><p>Freiburg began with above-average car use until things started to change around 1970. Bike networks, expanded light rail, pedestrianisation and deliberately planning new developments for both homes and businesses close to public transport all contributed to the transition. By 1980 the car officially took second priority to pedal, foot and mass transit. By 2008 the city had several cycle-only streets, and nine out of ten residents lived in areas where traffic could not go faster than 30km p/h (19 mph).</p><p>In many areas the speed limit drops to 7km p/h (5 mph). The city set an example now widely being emulated.</p>',

            description: "<p>In an attempt to address congestion and worsening air quality, the historic centre of Nuremberg was progressively pedestrianized from the early 1970s. Potential road chaos resulting from the moves, predicted by some planners, did not materialise, nor did a loss of customers to local shops warned of by business owners. Neither, again, did the warned-of wholesale transfer of traffic onto nearby roads occur. There were only marginal numbers that did, and there was actually a significant reduction of cars.</p><p>In 1988 the last through-route was closed in a trial that was, at the time, the focus of a high level of protest and opposition, especially from retailers. Again, severe congestion in adjacent streets was forecast but never materialised. Over a 12 month period total traffic reduced by around one quarter, with only marginal displacement to nearby streets, and in 1989 the measures went from trial to being permanent. Over the course of the year air pollution fell significantly with nitrogen dioxide levels falling by around 30%.</p><p>Subsequently there was a programme of continual improvement of the city centre public space. The actual traffic reduction transpired to be double what was expected.</p><p>Before the measures were introduced there was substantial public consultation and long term measuring of traffic flows afterwards to understand &lsquo;knock&rsquo;-on&rsquo; effects.</p><p>Instead of traffic simply being displaced to other parts of the city within its outer ring road, the initial absolute reduction continued in following years. It meant that against a backdrop of rising car ownership, between 1989 and 2000, there was a reduction of 10,000 vehicles on city centre area roads.</p>",

            description: "<p>In terms of air pollution, the worst-hit city in the world recently has been Delhi &ndash; where traffic has been growing inexorably and is a major contributor to poor air quality. Other contributing factors include dust from construction, pollution from factories and power stations, the burning of fuel and the burning of crops.</p><p>To lower levels of dangerous &lsquo;particulate matter&rsquo;, the Supreme Court in 1998 ordered that public transport shift from diesel fuel to compressed natural gas.Other measures included the introduction of unleaded petrol and lowering the sulphur content of fuels. Standards for legally permissible pollution levels from vehicles have also been tightened along with the introduction of penalties for burning rubbish.</p><p>But all of these have been progressively overwhelmed by trends like the rise in vehicle numbers. In a decade from 2002 to 2012 they&nbsp;nearly doubled&nbsp;in Delhi, increasing 97 percent. Officially, Delhi is now kerosene free and most households use LPG for cooking. But in spite of positive steps like the switching of public transport to cleaner fuel, pollution is still responsible for 10,000-30,000 annual deaths in Delhi according to India&rsquo;s Centre for Science and Environment.</p><p>Delhi had a crisis moment in November 2016 when particulate matter rose to over ten times the highest acceptable healthy limit. This led to what is known as the odd-even initiative. For a limited period of time, private cars in the city were controlled, with private cars being allowed onto the roads on alternate days according to whether their number plates bore odd or even numbers. The initiative faced opposition and legal challenges. Reportedly around nine out of ten people opposed the initiative prior to its implementation with a majority switching to being supportive after the fact.</p><p>New Delhi authorities reported falls in pollution of up to 25 percent in the two week duration of the scheme and reduced levels of congestion. In addition to raisingpublic awareness of the problem, the introduction of odd/even also improved road conditions for public transport making it more efficient. Official figures reported that public buses &ndash; which have a daily target of covering 200km but typically only managed 160km &ndash; managed to serve 220km per day5. Bus passenger numbers increased from 4.7 million per day to 5.3 million.</p><p>Since its initial introduction the odd / even scheme has been used successively during the smog season when air quality has dramatically worsened.</p>",

            description: "<p>A city that has become synonymous with traffic and congestion is Milan, Italy. It has, at varying times, taken measures to address its problems. In 2012 the city authorities introduced a selective vehicle charge to reduce traffic and improve air quality. It was scrapped after a legal challenge by a private car park claimed it was affecting their business.</p><p>The impact of the forced removal of the traffic charge after several months was surprising, with vehicles returning immediately. During the schemes there had been an overall decline in vehicle numbers of 14.5 percent when only 19 percent of vehicles were subject to the charge. The initiative was later restored, but the advent of the coronavirus pandemic led to a more ambitious plan to reduce traffic in Milan.</p><p><strong>Open streets</strong><br />Now, Milan&rsquo;s municipal Strade Aperte (Open Streets) initiative is being cited as a model for improving the quality of central urban environments. It was triggered as local politicians feared that restrictions on public transport might cause serious health and environmental problems if people switched to cars. In order to ensure that space was available for social distancing, local authorities set out to reduce the space available for cars and increase it for pedestrians, cyclists and people using electric bikes and motorcycles. These measures are now intended to be permanent.</p><p>The measures include 35km of new cycle lanes, new and wider pavements, and expanded areas for children to play in. Some streets now give priority to people walking and cycling and 30kph (20mph) speed limits have been introduced on multiple roads. In one area known as the Lazaretto a low traffic neighbourhood has been created. and on the main Corso Buenos Aires, new bike lanes have been created along major shopping streets which are being combined with other measures in efforts towards pedestrianisation. Milan could also be said to have started a trend in Italy.</p><p><strong>The &lsquo;15 minute neighbourhood&rsquo; &ndash; reimagining town and city life</strong><br />Behind the practical steps taken by Milanese authorities is a bigger vision. The aim is to make Lazzaretto and Isola pilot projects for ensuring that everything people need to live their lives is within a 15-minute walking distance.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Open Squares&rsquo; - improving the public realm with more and better space</strong><br />Italy&rsquo;s famous town and city squares reveal the importance of public space and a high quality public realm for urban life. &lsquo;Open squares&rsquo; is another component related to the new measures in which 15 city squares have been improved over an 18 month period by increasing space for pedestrians and active travel such as cycling.</p>",

            description: "<p>A street bordering Brooklyn's Prospect Park in New York was reduced in 2010 from three vehicle traffic lanes to two, with the third lane turned into a two way bicycle lane. It was installed to the great delight of New York cyclists, and the extreme annoyance of some powerful and well-connected people living adjacent. A legal case was brought against the change led by a high-powered law firm.</p><p>Opponents claimed that the benefits of the bike lane were overstated by city authorities. Opponents also complained that the new bike lane had been imposed on the community, even though it was approved by the transport committee of the <a href='https://nymag.com/news/features/bike-wars-2011-3/'>relevant local Community Board</a>. Another familiar refrain was heard in the local debate &ndash; that businesses would suffer lost custom.</p><p>After a failed attempt in the 1980s to create major bike lanes, a new Transport Commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, supported by New York&rsquo;s Mayor Bloomberg, promoted the notion of the &lsquo;complete street&rsquo; &ndash; a place for more than cars &ndash; and oversaw the introduction of 255 miles of bike lanes up to Spring 2011. The number of people cycling to work doubled between 2006 and 2010 according to the authorities.</p><p>The bike lane in Prospect Park West was built in a month, and other lanes have been introduced much quicker. Their cost is a tiny fraction of the cost of road repairs, and streets with protected bike lanes saw 40% fewer accidents.</p><p>By 2012, six years into the Bloomberg administration, <a href'https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/nyregion/most-new-yorkers-say-bike-lanes-are-a-good-idea.html'>66% of New Yorkers</a> had come round to thinking that bike lanes were a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;. Only 27% said that they were a bad idea.</p><p>In 2016, five years after the lawsuit was brought against the Prospect Park West bike lane, a move which some said <a href='https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2016/09/22/good-riddance-to-the-prospect-park-west-bike-lane-lawsuit/'>nearly sank New York City&rsquo;s bike program</a>, the action was dropped. One of the reasons the lawsuit failed, apart from lack of legal merit and factual grounds, was the steadfastness of certain councillors and the city authorities in the face of vocal but poorly grounded criticism.</p>",
